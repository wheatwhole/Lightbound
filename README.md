<h1 align="center">⭐ LIGHTBOUND ⭐</h1>

Lightbound is a linear, stage-based action-platformer where you control Lucia, a daring adventurer with Air powers in an elemental world. Each ability is used in both traversal and combat, letting you navigate levels with speed and precision while creatively defeating enemies and solving puzzles.
The story begins with a small, personal goal (retrieving a stolen artifact) but quickly escalates as Lucia uncovers a greater evil threatening the balance of the elements.
